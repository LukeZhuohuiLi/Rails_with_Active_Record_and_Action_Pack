The dependency therubyracer (>= 0) will be unused by any of the platforms Bundle                      r is installing for. Bundler is installing for x86-mingw32 but the dependency is                       only for ruby. To add those platforms to the bundle, run `bundle lock --add-pla                      tform ruby`.
